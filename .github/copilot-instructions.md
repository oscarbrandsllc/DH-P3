Before modifying any code, thoroughly review the existing files that will be affected.

Analyze the relevant sections related to prompt to fully understand the current HTML structure, JavaScript rendering logic, data flow, and CSS styling

Make sure you are always very thorough, and review files necessary for context, so that you have working knowledge and full understanding of the project.
