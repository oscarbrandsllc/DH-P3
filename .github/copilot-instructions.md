DO NOT REFERENCE UNLESS SESSION HAS JUST STARTED WITH THE FIRST PROMPT!!

If chat session just started with initial prompt, follow complete instructions below along with prompt. 
If session is continuing, follow prompt instructions only!
Aside from initial prompt, throughout the chat session, always follow latest instructions given in most recent prompt, do not focus on past instructions unless spcified, or needed for context.
Before starting to code. Thoroughly review the code in files listed at bottom of the page. We had just recently built the stats page, and a lot of what i wanted was done incorrectly and its far from where i want it, although it is ok for a start. I need you to fully understand the Reference Folder/CDX_FullConversation.md file which has the entire conversation i had with codex about building the stats page, from original prompt to most recent changes.
i want you to understand the full structure and everything of both of the js and css files, because it is important that you have a working knowledge of the code for the changes we will be making.

At bottom of prompt are files and their paths that you need to go through, and what they are for.

Stats page does not exclusively use it's specific files, it does use some shared code from the main app files. But Please go through everything thoroughly so that you understand all the little complexities of the app , and YOU NEED TO also  go through entire codex session to understand exactly what my requests were, and what was done incorrectly. 
Read the entire session/conversation i had with codex line by line for stats page being built.
 I made CDX_FullConversation.md file in references folder, and pasted entire conversation, from the original prompt till the most recent changes. The comments indicate what part is prompt and what part is response from codex.

dont code, just Read through everything so you can understand exactly how everything happened, what i was requesting, and what im upset about, before we start making any changes.
