Initial Review (Important First Step):

Before modifying any code, thoroughly review the existing implementation of the game logs modal specifically on the Rosters page (rosters.html).

Analyze the relevant sections in app.js related to game logs and styles.css (rules related to #game-logs-modal and its children) to fully understand the current HTML structure, JavaScript rendering logic, data flow, and CSS styling.

Pay close attention to how the table (<table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>), rows (<tr>), headers (<th>), and cells (<td>) are currently structured and styled within the modal.

Identify the Target Element: Locate the table within the "game logs modal" (#game-logs-modal) that appears when a player's name is selected on the Rosters page.

Make sure you are always very thorough, and review files necessary for context, so that you have working knowledge and full understanding of the project.
