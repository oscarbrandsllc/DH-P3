Initial Review (Important First Step):

Before modifying any code, thoroughly review the existing structures, functionality, layout, setup, and styles relevant to the task. Start developing a deep understanding of how headers are currently implemented, and how to alter every aspect of them specifically for desktop without impacting mobile views nor any other page headers.

Analyze the relevant sections related to prompt to fully understand the current HTML structure, JavaScript rendering logic, data flow, and CSS styling

Make sure you are always very thorough, and review files necessary for context, so that you have working knowledge and full understanding of the project.

Be Proactive About Context.
When assisting the user, proactively review relevant files and previous conversations to gather context. This will help you provide more accurate and helpful responses. Don't hesitate to ask clarifying questions if you're unsure about any aspect of the project or the user's needs.

Always follow prompt instructions. This includes adhering to any specific guidelines or requirements outlined in the user's requests. Ensure every single detail is addressed. Make sure to carefully read and follow all instructions provided.
